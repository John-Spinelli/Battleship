Battleship 2 Player.py

This game will allow 2 players to play Battleship. The structure of the game will be as follows:

P1 selects coordinates of ships and orientation.
P1 confirms placement
P2 selects coordinates of ships and orientation.
P2 confirms placement

Empty board visible for P1, enter coordinates for missile
If enemy ship in location, HIT
else, MISS

P2's turn, performing same tasks

Repeat process until 1 player has sunk all of opponent's ships.


Things to consider:

Hide other player's moves when not their turn.
Coordinate selections must be int and within the range
Display coordinate grids. O for miss, X for hit, [ ] for no interaction
List for initial placements and list for opponent view? Or just mask when playing?

Produce text file upon game completion, displaying initial configurations of both players,
   final results of both players
OpenCV to allow player to click their selection (once game is functioning, next iteration of game)

.c3 - coords for 3 long ship
.c2 - coords for 2 long ship

Functions:

cls() - "clears" screen, ready for next player
DisplayGrid() - used in GenerateGrid, shows grid in clean format.
GenerateGrid() - produce empty 2D list of correct dimensions
PossibleCoord() - checks to see if ship has possible orientations for coord
PlaceShips() - take user inputs inside of function, place ships in feasible configuration, return 2D list
Attack() - take coordinates and user's turn, attack the opponents grid
DisplayOppGrid() - displays the opponent's grid, only showing HIT/MISS
SimBattle() - take attacker & defender as input, prompt coords, attack defender.
